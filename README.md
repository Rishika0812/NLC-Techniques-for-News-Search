## 🛠️ How It Works

### 🔹 Preprocessing
Cleans and tokenizes raw news text, removes stop words, and performs lemmatization or stemming.

### 🔹 Classification
Trains or uses a pre-trained NLC model to categorize the news articles (e.g., politics, sports, technology).

### 🔹 Search Engine
Accepts user input to fetch relevant articles based on category or keyword matching.
